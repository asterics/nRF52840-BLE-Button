# nRF52840-BLE-Button

A BLE keyboard demo using the affordable Tenstar Robot nrf52840 devboard (aka nice!nano, a good summary is provided at the [Zephyr documentation page](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/others/promicro_nrf52840/doc/index.html). The source code builds with PlatformIO, using the Adafruit nRF52 and Bluefruit libraries. The code is based upon the [BLE keyboard example](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino/blob/master/libraries/Bluefruit52Lib/examples/Peripheral/blehid_keyboard/blehid_keyboard.ino)

## Requirements

* install VSCode/PlatformIO and build a project for the Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express (or a similar Adafruit nRF board, to install the nRF platform packages) 
* add the files for the nice nano board as described here: [Nicenano-NRF52-Supermini-PlatformIO-Support](https://github.com/ICantMakeThings/Nicenano-NRF52-Supermini-PlatformIO-Support)

## Usage

* build and upload the demo code (note that the Serial USB CDC interface must be enabled in the code in order to use the auto-upload via DFU in PlatformIO)
* pair the BLE device (nrf52840)
* connect up to 5 pushbuttons from GPIO pins 017, 020, 022, 024 and 100 to GND
* when pressed, the buttons shall trigger keys (default settings are: `SPACE` , `ENTER`, `1`, `2` and `3`)

### Notes regarding low power operation / current consumption
In paired active mode, current consumption is about 1.2mA @ 3,3V (which can reduced to ~1mA if the activity LED is not used).  
After an adjustable time of user inactivity (constant `SLEEP_TIMEOUT_MS`), the nRF enters hibernation / deep sleep where current consumption drops to 
~1,4uA @ 3,7V. (For this, the LDO for providing external VCC must be disabled, else around 40uA are consumed). This could be further improved by supplying power directly to the VDD pin on the backside of the PCB, see [this post in the Arduino forum](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/nrf52840-development-board-with-adafruit-nrf52-core/1290505/6)
A wakeup can be triggered by pressing any of the configured buttons. This will cause a system reset. BLE connection to a paired host is usually re-established in 1-3 seconds.
